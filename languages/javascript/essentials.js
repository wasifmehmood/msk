// ECMAScript => Eurpean Computer Manufacturer Association.
// It is not the language itself but the official description of how the language should be
// interpreted by the browsers.
// What is ECMAScript?
// The specification describing how browsers should implement and interpret JavaScript.

// Javascript is an prototype based object oriented programming language. An opinionated coding language.
// Each object is a unique instance of an object prototype
// Q1: What does it mean when we say JavaScript is an "object-oriented" language?
// ANS1: JavaScript is modeled around objects with properties and methods which can be handled in a modular fashion.
// Q2: What happens to the website and the code when you write code in the browser console?
// ANS2: Code in the browser console impacts the current browser instance only. It exists in the console for as long as the window is open.

// Build tools: 
    // babel, webpack, npm, gulp
    // Used to turn human written/understandable code into code optimized for the browser.

// Node.js
    // Javascript server runtime used to run javascript everywhere.

// async keyword in script tag:
    // Browser downloads JavaScript in parallel while HTML renders. When JavaScript is fully loaded, rendering
    // stops while JavaScript is executed.

// defer keyword in script tag:
    // Browser downloads JavaScript in parallel while HTML renders, then defers execution of JavaScript until
    // HTML rendering is complete.

// type module in script tag is always defferd.
