// Core Principles of Functional programming.

// 1: Pure/Impure Functions
//  Pure: Should only depends upon its input and it should not rely on any outside value to produce a return value.
//  Impure: The opposite of pure functions.

// Pure Funcs are easier to test.

// 2: Immutable Data:

// 3: Higher Order Functions:
    // Takes a func as an argument or returns the func itself.
    // Builtin HOF: Array Map.
    // i.e. Funct as return value: const appendEmoji = (fixed) => (dynamic) => fixed + dynamic;

// OOP vs Functional
// OOP / Imperative approach => Gives a a clear set of statements to follow to get the object to its final state.
// Functional / declarative approach => Describes the state and logic involved but has no opinion on the 
//  actual control flow
