# What are design fundamentals

** Design fundamentals can be four broad categories that are equally important, 
  that are very much intertwined and that are build upon each other. **

1. Underlying or foundational knowledge => client server arch, etc
2. Key characteristics of the system => the things you might want your system to having or you might be trading off. I.e        
    Availability, latency, throughput, redundancy, consistency
3. Actual components of the system => load balancers, proxies, hashes, rate limiting, leader election.
4. Actual tech => nginx, redis, amazon s3, cloud storage.
