# Data Types
- Data type specifies the type of the data that can be stored inside the variables.

1. Primitive
2. Reference

## Primitive:
- It is a type which is built into to the java language. Primitive data type is nothing but our type, which stores the values directly inside it and not the reference. i.e,
- byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char

- Byte, short, int, and long stores the integral values, non-floating, non-decimal values with the specific range.

### Memory allocated
- byte 1 byte
- short 2 bytes
- integer 4 bytes
- float 4 bytes
- long 8 bytes
- double 8 bytes
- char 2 bytes (Unicode encoding)
- boolean 1 byte (true, false)

- Note: Unicode Char encode (2 bytes) while ASCII code (1 byte) used in C programming

## Reference:
- The type created using Objects. i.e,
    arrays, strings

- Reference type does not have a specific size or a byte range. Whatever data you stored inside it as per that, the memory gets allocated.
