# Features of Java
- OOP (Object Oriented)
- Secured => 
- Platform Independent
- Interpreted
- High Performance
- Portable
- Multithreaded
- Architectural Neutral

## Secured: 
- Because there is no explicit pointers and also it runs inside VM (virtual machine) sandbox

## Platform Independent:
- Write once, run everywhere

## Interpreted:
It is run line by line, so whatever errors or bugs we get, can be solved in-hand.

# Architectural Neutral
- It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports the native languages, which are C or C++ functions to be implemented.
