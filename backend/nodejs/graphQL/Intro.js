// Rest API is a stateless, client-idependent API for exchange of data.
// we dont render views, we dont store sessions, we dont care about the client, we only 
// get requests, parse the data and return responses with data, typically json data.

// GraphQL API is also a stateless, client-independent API for exchanging data with higher query flexibility.
