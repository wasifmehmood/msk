// SQL vs NOSQL

// SQL:
// Data uses schemas
// Relations
// Data is ditributed across multiple tables
// Horizontal scaling is difficult/impossible; Vertical scaling is possible
// Limitations for lots of read & write queries per second

// NOSQL:
// Schema-Less
// No (or very few) Relations
// Data is typically merged / nested in a few collections
// Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible
// Great performance for mass read & write requests

// SQL when data is not changed frequently else NOSQL
