// Unit Test:
// Types: Isolated, Shallow, Deep Integeration

// Isolation: A unit might contain buisness logic that needs to be tested in isolation;
    // In Isolation we always should our deps.
// Shallow: In Shallow we only test a single component with its template
// Deep Integeration: In deep integeration test we test many components actually having child componenets.
