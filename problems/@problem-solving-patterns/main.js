/************ Frequency Counter Pattern Start************/

// 1: Frequency Counter Pattern
// When should this pattern be used?
// Frequency counters are most frequently used to compare data in some way. 
// Some common problems I have seen on Leetcode where a frequency counter could be used are 
// ones that compare different arrays or strings, such as checking whether two strings are 
// anagrams of each other.
// Used mostly on string and arrays

// Why use this pattern?
// a. Helps to avoid using a nested loop ( O(n2) => O(n))

/************ Sliding Window Start************/

// 2: Sliding Window:
    // Following are some ways you can identify that the given problem might require a sliding window:
    // a. The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array, or string.
    // b. You’re asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value.

    // Common problems you use the sliding window pattern with:
    // a. Maximum sum subarray of size ‘K’ (easy)
    // b. Longest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (medium)
    // c. String anagrams (hard)
